# Firebase Asynchronous Data Access Issue

This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase when dealing with asynchronous data retrieval.  The issue arises from attempting to access data from a document snapshot before the data has finished loading. This can lead to unexpected errors or application crashes.

The `bug.js` file contains code that improperly handles the asynchronous nature of Firebase data retrieval, resulting in errors. The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected code, demonstrating how to properly handle asynchronous operations and check for the existence of data before accessing it.  Always ensure your application correctly handles the asynchronous behavior of Firebase to prevent these types of issues.
